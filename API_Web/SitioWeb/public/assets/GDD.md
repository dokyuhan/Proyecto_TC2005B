### **Summary**

Welcome to _Awakening of the Realms_, a captivating Deck Building Game where you will journey through diverse opponents and enchanting kingdoms. Embark on an adventure by selecting one of four distinct kingdoms, each offering unique benefits and challenges. Embrace the strengths of your chosen kingdom and engage in battle. Skillfully construct your deck, using the individual abilities of each card to strategize and adapt your approach with every turn. Immerse yourself in the game's dark fantasy aesthetic for an experience that promises to be truly unforgettable.

### **Gameplay**

Upon launching the game for the first time, players are asked when creating a user to select one of four distinct realms: Human, Magic, Celestial, and Monster. This initial choice is important for gameplay. The players kick off with three basic cards from all realms, this will lay the foundation for their initial matches. Progressing on the game the player would be able to assemble the deck as the player needs and would be able to get more and better cards. Before starting the matches the player would have to configure his deck up to 10 cards. Each deck can be configured with 10 cards composing of 8 common and 2 legendary cards. The player can configure the deck strategically and depending on the players gamestyle. Also players must adapt their strategies, choosing between aggressive or defensive tactics.

Battles are structured such that players start with five cards in hand, from which they can play up to two cards each turn. As the match progresses the player will keep on receiving a random cycle of the cards on his deck, this means that the card used in a round can appear again in the hand deck. Tactical thinking is essential, as players must decide whether to attack, defend, heal, or employ a mix of these strategies to deplete their opponent's health bar of 100 hit points. Similarly, players themselves have 100 hit points, with the potential to recover or even exceed this threshold through strategic play of healing cards. Also in order to use legendary cards the player must have enough energy, each turn will give +1 energy. An energy gage would show the amount of energy avialble, the energy goes down after the player used the legendary card.

Matches unfold with each player's turn occurring simultaneously, so both players must select two cards to play. Victory in a match awards the players 450 coins for buying new cards in the game shop. Upon purchasing the card it will be permanently unlocked on the player's inventory. Also, beating your oponent will open the next level for the player, but be aware that beating the same level multiple times won't give you coins.

This gaming mechanism promises to immerse players deeply in the enchanting universe of _Awakening of the Realms_, offering an extraordinary and engaging experience.

### **Mindset**

In our game, the primary aim is to evoke feelings of adventure, empowerment, and strategic thinking within the player. We plan to create these emotions through several key aspects:

**Empowerment:** Players are expected to feel a growing sense of empowerment and progression as they advance through the game. This is achieved by unlocking new cards and mastering their skills. The decision-making process involved in improving their deck and deploying cards in epic battles allows players to enjoy the thrill of overcoming obstacles and outsmarting their adversaries.

**Adventure:** The various realms within the game are designed to provide a spirit of adventure. Players have the autonomy to select their preferred realm and dive into the unique advantages it offers. Encounters with opponents from contrasting realms will prompt players to contemplate their realm choice, adding depth and intrigue to their journey.

**Strategy:** The diversity of cards available, each with its own set of statistics, encourages players to engage in strategic thinking and meticulous planning. Selecting the right cards, efficiently managing resources, and adapting to evolving scenarios are crucial elements that keep players absorbed and entertained from start to finish.

By weaving together these elements, our game aims to provide an immersive experience that challenges players intellectually while simultaneously offering them a sense of growth, exploration, and mastery.

However, the outcome is uncertain until both players have played their cards. Suppose Player X plays two cards resulting in 10 attack, 25 defense, and no healing. The resolution is as follows:

       - Your 17 attack is fully absorbed by Player X's 25 defense, with their residual defense dissipating.

       - Your 8 defense successfully blocks 8 out of Player X's 10 attack, resulting in a mere 2 hit point loss.

       - Your healing boosts your health by 5, placing you 3 hit points above your starting total.

Here is an example of how the main screen will look like when the game opens (subject to changes), we wanted to a sneak peak of all 4 realms:

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;">

  <div style="flex: 0 0 48%; margin-bottom: 20px; display: flex; justify-content: center; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
    <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Menu Background</h2>
    <img src="Menu_Background.png" alt="Menu Background" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">
  </div>

</div>

### **Style Attributes**

For _Awakening of the Realms_ we will be having a rich and immersive color palette that reflects the dark fantasy aesthetic of the game. Each Realm (levels) will have its own distinct color scheme to have its unique characteristics present. The Human Realm will have warm and earth-like tones. The Magic Realm will have blue, purple, cold and mystical colors. The celestial Realm will have white and gold details. The Monster Realm will have dark shadow colors and reds.

The artistic style is based on a combination between fantasy and a semi-realistic scenario. Environments and cards will have fantasy characteristics that relate to realistic features. For example; an archer will have realistic features mixed with some fantasy attributes. We intend to generate all cards using the AI _MidJourney_, one of the best in the market for image generation. This AI will ensure all cards have a similar realistic but a paper and grainy look to them. All the prompts for image generation will be sourced from the AI _ChatGPT_.

### **Graphics Needed**

## _Sounds/Music_

### **Style Attributes**

The primary audio experience will revolve around a captivating medieval/fantasy backdrop, enriched with the melodic resonance of fundamental instruments such as drums, horns, trumpets and old guitas. During non-match moments in the game, the audio will evoke a sense of adventure, immersing players in an epic journey. However, as players transition into intense gameplay scenarios, the audio dynamically shifts, enveloping them in an immersive battle atmosphere.

The game's audio landscape will be characterized by enchanting sound effects and musical compositions, seamlessly intertwining to evoke a magical and adventurous ambiance. Each note and sound element will contribute to a cohesive and evocative auditory journey, enhancing the overall gaming experience and drawing players deeper into the fantastical realms of the medieval world.
