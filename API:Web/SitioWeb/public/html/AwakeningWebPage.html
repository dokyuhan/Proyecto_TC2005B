          <h2>How does a match work?</h2>
          <p>
            Initially, players receive 16 random cards from all realms and can
            later customize decks up to 10 cards, evolving to include 8 common
            and 2 legendary cards. Each match starts with players holding six
            cards, allowing to play of up to two cards per turn. Make strategic
            choices that involve attacking, defending, or healing to manage
            health points. A legendary card requires energy, gained by playing
            other cards. Every card played gives one energy point. Matches
            progress with simultaneous turns under a timer. Victories provide
            coins for purchasing new cards. Have fun and become the hero of the
            realms!
